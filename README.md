# MotionSense-LSTM-HAR
This project develops a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to classify activities

The system employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to model temporal dependencies in the data, leveraging a preprocessing pipeline that includes sensor selection, sliding window segmentation (100 samples, stride 50), and standardization via scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler. Implemented in Python with PyTorch, the system achieves a test accuracy of 95.31% through supervised learning with the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss over 55 epochs. The design prioritizes temporal coherence and computational efficiency, with a detailed workflow visualized in a flowchart. The repository includes code for data gathering, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, offering an extensible framework for further experimentation with alternative models or preprocessing techniques. This project is ideal for researchers and practitioners exploring deep learning for HAR applications.
